            <h1>a wee twig</h1>
            <p>This website is run by Gongtzu, who has been working as a project manager of web development. This job inspired her a lot; therefore, she soon started her programming journey. She is highly motivated, disciplined and a fast learner. By writing these posts, not only can she keep updated with the new technology but share knowledge. How awesome is that!</p>
            <br>
            <h3>About Gongtzu</h3>
            <p>She is currently a project manager at rIDEA, a digital design company based in Taipei, Taiwan. She has helped several local and international companies establish their official websites, e-commerce or ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems. The job is also in high need of program logic and interpersonal skills.</p>
            <p>With a passion for both personal growth and web development, she attended coding bootcamps to learn new languages while sharpening existing skills. Meanwhile, she is continuously learning from other senior developers at work. She is eager to tackle more complex problems in the future and continue to find ways to maximize user efficiency.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Previous Experience</h3>
            <p>She obtained her bachelor's degree in political science at the National Taiwan University in 2015 and finished the master's program at the University of Edinburgh 5 years later.</p>
            <p>Before she got to know more about coding, she was a curator of a local contemporary gallery. Since holding exhibitions requires interdisciplinary teamwork, she had rich experience in person-to-person communication and collaboration.</p>
